Rules for the Crash Team Racing side tournament hosted by Alan James/TaroNuke.

---

The qualifier is the best *individual lap* in a 3 lap time trial on Sewer Speedway (meaning you have 3 laps to attempt to not choke the walljump lmao). The top 16 will make it into a 1vs1 single elimination bracket.

The matches in the bracket will be best of 3, and will follow a pick-pick-random format. That is to say, higher seed picks the first track, lower seed picks the 2nd track, and if it goes to game 3, the final track is random.

The final round will be a best of 5, which is taking turns picking (high seed first), with game 5 being random.

Rules for races:
ANY Skip/Out of Bounds/etc. is allowed.
Penta Penguin is banned as a character (due to region differences)
NO CPU drivers will be present.
Weapons during races are allowed.
